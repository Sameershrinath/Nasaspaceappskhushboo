        🌟 Polaris – The North Star ⭐
    </h2>
  <br><pre>
    Also Called the North Star 🧭
Polaris is called the North Star because it always stays in the same spot in the sky in the northern hemisphere.

Helps with Directions 🗺
People and sailors use Polaris to find north and navigate at night.

Very Bright ✨
Polaris is a bright star, so it’s easy to see in the night sky.

Part of a Big Family 🌌
Polaris is not alone; it’s part of a triple star system, meaning it has two smaller stars that orbit around it.

Far Away 🌠
Polaris is about 430 light-years away from Earth.

<h2>💡 Fun Facts</h2>
<br><pre>
   Polaris is like a guide in the sky—even though stars move at night, Polaris seems almost stationary, which is why it’s special!

   Even though the night sky moves, Polaris stays almost perfectly still, like a guiding light in the sky!
