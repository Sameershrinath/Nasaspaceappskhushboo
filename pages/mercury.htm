        <h2>🌟 Mercury – The Swift Planet</h2>
  <br><pre>Closest to the Sun 🌞
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, so it’s very hot during the day and very cold at night.

Smallest Planet 🪐
Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system, even smaller than some moons!

No Atmosphere ❌
Mercury has almost no atmosphere, so it can’t trap heat, which makes its temperatures swing from very hot to very cold.

Surface 🪨
Mercury is covered with craters and rocky plains, kind of like the Moon.

Fast Orbit ⚡
Mercury orbits the Sun quickly—it takes only 88 Earth days to go around the Sun once.

Slow Spin ⏳
Even though it moves fast around the Sun, one day on Mercury is very long—it takes about 59 Earth days to rotate once!
<br></pre></div>
<h2>💡 Fun Fact:</h2><br>
<pre>Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, it’s very hard to see from Earth, and you can usually spot it just before sunrise or just after sunset.</pre>
