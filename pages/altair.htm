        🌠 Altair — The Flying Star!
    </h2>
  <br><pre>
     Altair is a bright star that shines high up in the sky.

It’s the head star of the Eagle constellation, which is called Aquila (that means “eagle” in Latin).

So you can imagine Altair as a soaring eagle flying across space! 🦅✨

<h2>🌟 Altair’s Special Features</h2>
<br><pre>
    💫 Altair is very close to Earth — only about 16.7 light-years away!
(That’s much closer than most stars we see at night.)

🌞 It’s about 1.8 times bigger than our Sun and shines about 11 times brighter!

</pre></div><br>
<h2>⚡ Altair spins super fast!</h2>
<br><pre>
     It spins around its axis once every 9 hours, while our Sun takes about 25 days!

Because it spins so quickly, Altair looks a bit squished — wider in the middle and flat at the top and bottom. 😄
