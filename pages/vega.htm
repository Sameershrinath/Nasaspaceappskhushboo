        <p>Hey! i am Vega...</p></div><br>
    <h2>
      ⭐ Vega – The Bright Blue Star
    </h2>
  <br><pre>
   Vega is one of the shiniest stars in the night sky! 🌌
It’s found in the constellation Lyra, which looks like a small harp or musical instrument. 🎵

It shines with a beautiful blue-white light, and if you look up on a clear summer night, Vega is one of the first stars you’ll spot twinkling! 🌠

<h2>🌞 Main Facts about Vega</h2>
<br><pre>
  💫 1. Very Bright: Vega is the 5th brightest star in the entire sky — you can even see it from cities!

🔥 2. Super Hot: Its surface temperature is around 9,600°C, almost twice as hot as the Sun!

🚀 3. Nearby Star: It’s about 25 light-years away, so the light we see left Vega 25 years ago.

💨 4. Fast Spinner: Vega spins so fast that it’s fatter in the middle and flatter at the top and bottom!

🧭 5. Future North Star: In about 12,000 years, Vega will become our North Star again — just like it was 14,000 years ago!

<h2>🎉 Fun Facts about Vega</h2><br>
<pre>
  🌟 Fun Fact 1: Vega was the first star (after the Sun) to be photographed and have its spectrum studied by astronomers! 📸🔭

🌈 Fun Fact 2: If you were to replace our Sun with Vega, it would look 40 times brighter in the sky — Earth would be way too hot to live on! ☀🔥

🪐 Fun Fact 3: Vega is part of the Summer Triangle, along with two other bright stars — Deneb and Altair. Together, they form a big triangle in the summer sky! 🔺🌌

🎶 Fun Fact 4: The name “Vega” comes from an Arabic word meaning “swooping eagle” — so it’s often called The Eagle Star! 🦅✨
