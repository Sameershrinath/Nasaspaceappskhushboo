       🌟 Saturn – The Ringed Planet 💍
    </h2>
  <br><pre>
        Famous for Its Rings ✨
Saturn is best known for its beautiful rings, made of ice, rock, and dust. They are huge and can be seen from space!

Gas Giant ☁
Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant, made mostly of hydrogen and helium. It doesn’t have a solid surface to stand on.

Huge Size 🪐
Saturn is the second-largest planet in the solar system, after Jupiter.

Many Moons 🌕
Saturn has over 80 moons! The biggest is Titan, which is bigger than Mercury and has lakes of liquid methane.

Fast Spins ⚡
One day on Saturn is very short—about 10.7 hours—because it spins very fast!

Faint Rings Have Gaps 💍
Saturn’s rings are made of many small rings with gaps, creating beautiful patterns.

Orbit Around the Sun 🌞
Saturn is far from the Sun—about 1.4 billion km (886 million miles) away—and takes 29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit.

Winds and Storms 🌪
Saturn has strong winds, some reaching 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph), and giant storms in its atmosphere.

<h2>💡 Fun Fact</h2>
<br><pre>
   Saturn is so light that if you could put it in a giant bathtub, it would float on water (because it’s mostly gas)!
