        <p>Hey! i am Neptune..</p></div><br>
    <h2>🌟 Neptune – The Blue Planet 🌊</h2>
  <br><pre>
      Farthest Planet 🌞
Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun, making it the farthest planet in our solar system.

Blue Color 🔵
Neptune looks bright blue because of the methane gas in its atmosphere.

A Gas Giant ☁
Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune is a gas giant, so it doesn’t have a solid surface to stand on.

Strong Winds 🌪
Neptune has the fastest winds in the solar system, blowing up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph)!

Rings 💍
Neptune has faint rings, but they are not as bright as Saturn’s rings.

Moons 🌕
Neptune has 14 known moons, and the largest is Triton, which is very cold and icy.

Long Year ⏳
Neptune takes 165 Earth years to go around the Sun once, so one “Neptune year” is very long!

<h2>💡 Fun Fact:</h2>
<br><pre> 
   Neptune is so far from the Sun that it’s very cold, but it still has storms and big, dark spots like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.

   you could stand on Neptune (hypothetically, since it’s a gas planet), you’d see blue skies, swirling clouds, and giant storms, and the winds would blow faster than a jet plane!
