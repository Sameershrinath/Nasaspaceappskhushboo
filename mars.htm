    <h2>🌟 Mars – The Red Planet</h2>
<pre>Colorful Planet 🔴
Mars is called the Red Planet because its surface looks red, like rust.

Smaller than Earth 🌍
Mars is about half the size of Earth and has less gravity, so you would feel lighter there!

Cold and Dry ❄
Mars is very cold and has a thin atmosphere, so it’s mostly dry desert with big rocks and dust.

Famous Volcanoes 🌋
Mars has the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is three times taller than Mount Everest!

Giant Canyon 🏞
It also has a huge canyon called Valles Marineris, which is much longer than the Grand Canyon.

Moons 🌕
Mars has two small moons, called Phobos and Deimos.

Exploration 🚀
Humans are sending robots and rovers to Mars to learn more about it.</pre>

<h2>💡 Fun Fact:</h2>
<pre>Because of its red color, some people call Mars “the fiery planet”, even though it’s really cold!
If you stood on Mars, the sky might look pinkish or butterscotch, and you could see Earth as a tiny bright star in the sky at night!
