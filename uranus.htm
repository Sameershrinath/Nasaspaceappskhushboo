        <h2>🌌 1. Where Uranus Is</h2>
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun — after Saturn and before Neptune.
It’s so far away that sunlight takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach it! ☀➡🪐

<h2>❄ 2. The Coldest Planet</h2>
Uranus is often called an “ice giant” because it’s full of frozen gases like water, ammonia, and methane.
It’s extremely cold — around –224°C, colder than any other planet in our Solar System! 🥶

<h2>💫 3. Its Weird Tilt</h2>
Here’s what makes Uranus special — it tilts on its side!
Most planets spin upright, but Uranus rolls like a ball on its side.
Scientists think a huge asteroid or planet might have hit Uranus long ago, knocking it over! 💥
Because of this, each pole of Uranus gets 42 years of sunlight and then 42 years of darkness! 🌞🌚

<h2>🌈 4. Its Blue-Green Color</h2>
Uranus looks blue-green because of the gas methane in its atmosphere.
Methane absorbs red light and reflects blue light, giving Uranus its beautiful color! 💎

<h2>🪐 5. Rings and Moons</h2>
Uranus has 13 dark, thin rings — not shiny like Saturn’s, but still very special.
It also has 27 moons, and many of them have fun names from Shakespeare’s plays, such as:

  🧚 Titania  👑 Oberon  🌙 Ariel  💫 Miranda

<h2>🚀 6. How Big It Is</h2>
Uranus is four times wider than Earth — about 51,000 kilometers across! 🌍➡🪐
It’s so big that 63 Earths could fit inside it!

<h2>🔭 7. Discovery</h2>
Uranus was discovered by William Herschel in 1781.
It was the first planet discovered with a telescope — before that, people didn’t know it existed!

<h2>✨ 8. Day and Year</h2>
☀ One day on Uranus = about 17 Earth hours (it spins fast!).

🌞 One year on Uranus = 84 Earth years — so if you were born on Uranus, you’d have to wait 84 Earth years to celebrate one birthday! 🎂

In short, Uranus is a cold, sideways-spinning ice giant with blue-green color, rings, and many moons. It’s one of the most unusual and fascinating planets in our Solar System! 🌌💙
